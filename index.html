          In 2022, I was selected for both the Honors Music Festival for High School and the prestigious Rubin-Ladd Foundation-Manhattan School of Music Summer Workshop. My musical journey reached new heights in 2023 when I earned multiple awards at the 16th Annual Charles Mingus High School Competition and Festival, including Outstanding Soloist Award, Specialized Combo Category Award, and Specialized Big Band Category Award. Most recently in 2024, I had the honor of performing with Sean Jones and the National Peer to Peer Jazz Sextet through the US Department of Education, further expanding my performance experience at the national level. These opportunities have allowed me to grow as both a performer and collaborator in diverse musical settings.

          My musical journey has been shaped by performing with diverse groups across New York City. I trained with the Brooklyn Youth Music Project and Harlem School of the Arts before developing my jazz foundation through Jazz at Lincoln Center's Middle School Jazz Academy and Jazz House Kids programs. At the Institute for Collaborative Education and LaGuardia High School, I've contributed to jazz bands, symphonic bands, and the Gospel Choir Band. Beyond school, I've grown through professional ensembles including the Bowery Jazz Messengers, Ben Sherman Quartet, and Mecadon McCune Quartet all experiences that have honed my skills in both large ensembles and intimate combo settings.
